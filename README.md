## 🤖 AI Feature Showcase — Step by Step

The AI Assistant is the main highlight of the app. Here's exactly how to run and demonstrate it:

### Prerequisites

Before launching the app, make sure you have a **Groq API key** (free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)):

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project
2. Add the following line:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

---

### 🚀 Step-by-Step: Showcasing the AI

#### Step 1 — Register or Log In
- Launch the app → tap **Register** to create a new account, or **Login** with existing credentials
- Use any valid email and password (Firebase Auth)

#### Step 2 — Seed Some Data (Important for AI context)
Before using the AI, add real data so it has something to analyze:

- Go to **Customer Orders** → tap the **＋** button → add at least 2–3 orders with different statuses (`Processing`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`)
- Go to **Inventory (Log List)** → tap **＋** → add items with statuses like `Low stock` or `Out-of-stock`

#### Step 3 — Open the AI Assistant
- From the Dashboard, tap the **AI Assistant** icon (sparkle ✨ icon in the bottom nav)
- The assistant greets you and shows **5 quick-tap suggestion chips**

#### Step 4 — Try These Suggested Questions (tap the chips or type manually)

| Question | What the AI Does |
|---|---|
| `How many orders are processing?` | Pulls live Firestore order data and counts by status |
| `Which products are low in stock?` | Lists all inventory items marked Low/Out-of-stock |
| `Give me a business summary` | Generates a full summary of orders + inventory |
| `How many customers do we have?` | Counts records from the customers collection |
| `Any out-of-stock products?` | Highlights critical stock alerts |

#### Step 5 — Ask Custom Questions
Type anything in the input bar, for example:
- *"Which orders haven't been delivered yet?"*
- *"What's the total number of inventory items?"*
- *"Summarize today's business status"*

The AI fetches **live data from Firestore** on every message, so answers always reflect the current state of your business.
