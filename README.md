# Markify — ParaCodeCode Business App

## 📱 About the App

**Markify** is a mobile application built with Flutter and Firebase that helps small businesses manage inventory and customer orders in one place. Staff can log and track inventory stock levels, manage customer orders, and receive real-time stock alerts — all from a clean, role-aware interface. Admins get additional controls to manage user roles and permissions across the team.
